### Notes
Aug 8: I found an example and got a basic menu bar app working that has a menu that has actions where I could issue start and stop and update the state of the menus. I also found a way to have a global hotkey registered, though I haven't been able to find a way to register it just by holding down only the right control key. That doesn't seem to work, but I did get it to work by using the function key F12 and having a trigger on hold down and key up. So key down, key up. That works. It prints the statement I want, however when I do that it doesn't seem to be updating the state of the menu bar icon the way that using the menu items does. So I'm trying to update the state to show that something is recording.
