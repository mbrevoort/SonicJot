# SonicJot

SonicJot is a MacOS app that runs in your menubar for turning thoughts into text via voice transcription. It uses whisper.cpp for local transcription or alternatively OpenAI transcription API (key required). Here's a [short demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzlYFtDQ_fE).

A build of the app is currently available through TestFlight but will be submitted to the App Store for review soon, for free. I expect/hope the MacOS update in 2024 will include significant improvements to transcription quality on-par with Whisper. 

I'll share the link to the App Store here when it's approved. In the meantime, here is a [public link to the latest version on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Sr6LHdsR).
